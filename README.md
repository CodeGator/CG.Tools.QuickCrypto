#### What does it do?
A tool for quick encryption / decryption, developed by CodeGator.

#### How do I install it?
I'm in the process of building an MSIX file, for my own use. I'm not yet sure whether it makes sense for me to try to publish that, anywhere. For your purposes, probably better to just build it with Visual Studio 2022, or later.
